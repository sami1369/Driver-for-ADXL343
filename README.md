# Driver-for-ADXL343
Develop a driver for a 3-axis Accelerometer (ADXL343) using the I2C communication protocol. The driver should be able to initialize the device, read acceleration data along the X, Y, and Z axes, and configure the accelerometer's range and resolution. Include unit tests to validate the functionality of your driver.
